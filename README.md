# 32x32-instructable

This is a simple skeleton project to get the STM32 Cube MX projects to work with a standard Eclipse config.
It also has, in the subfolder 'hw/', a STM32 Cube MX project (for version 1.4), and a patch to apply to the generated 'main.c' to get the awesome plasma effect on a 32x32 RGB LED display!
